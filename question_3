A branch is a point at which the repository has been split in two. Work may 
continue on the newly created branch whilst leaving the un-branched data 
unaffected. Once work has been completed on the new branch it may be merged 
back in to the master branch, at which time all data from the new branch will 
now reside in the master branch. As such, the new branch can safely be deleted.

In the event that work also continues on the master branch simultaneously with 
the new branch, a conflict may occur upon merging if the same data has been 
modified differently within each branch. In this case the user must manually 
resolve the conflict before a merge can occur.
